          <h1>About</h1>
			<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Jenny Edison! I am a midwest-based graphic designer/artist/student. I find myself in a unique position to offer insights from the fringes. And though my career is still in its infancy, I am proud of the work I have done in school and freelance. My main project interests include exploring the neurodiversity of the world, finding beauty in the mundane, and creating products that allow others a more enjoyable and seamless experience.</p>
